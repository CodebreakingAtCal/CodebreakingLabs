    "## Hash Functions and Collision Exploits\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hash function**, denoted $H(x)$, is a deterministic function taking in some arbitrary amount of data, and outputting a fixed amount of data that appears random. Hash functions are used to condense a bunch of data down into a tag that _almost_ uniquely identifies it. As we will see in this lab, the _almost_ unique characteristic of a hash can be exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's go over a use case of hashing. Hash functions are often used to store passwords. Imagine a scenario in which you are signing up for a website using your typical password \"_donut123_\". The website, without knowing that a bad guy secretly has access to its database, stores \"_donut123_\" in their database of login information. At this point, your beloved \"_donut123_\" password is completely compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, imagine a scenario in which the website stores a hashed version of your password \"_donut123_\" instead. The adversary (who can see the website's database) will only have access to a bunch of strings of characters that appears random. In this case, your \"_donut123_\" password is safe, and the adversary will not be able to login to your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites store a hashed version of your password rather than the actual plaintext version. During any given login request, the website will compare $H(submitted\\_password)$ to their stored database entry hash for the given username to see if they are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "By nature, hash functions will result in collisions. An infinite amount of inputs returning a limited amount of hashes (fixed length output) means that some inputs will return the same output hash. \n",
    "\n",
    "![hash_function.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114739901/218287160-c01f5c31-3248-4cf1-aeef-324fa6c1a184.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"attack\" on a hash function usually involves finding a *collision*, that is, two values $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $m_1 \\neq m_2$ and $H(m_1) = H(m_2)$. Say the adversary with access to the website database had the hash of your password, $H(p)$, and was able to find some value $k$ such that $H(k) = H(p)$. They could submit your username and the password $k$ to the server, which would then be accepted as the correct password in the eyes of the website!"

    "Textbook RSA is particularly susceptible to a **chosen-ciphertext attack**, in which our attacker Eve can choose an arbitrary ciphertext and have it decrypted by Bob. For example, she can encrypt a message using his public key and have him tell her the result of decrypting it.\n",

We will see how a variant of it can be used to gradually reveal the full message, however, relying on the non-padded nature of RSA. \n",

    "Say Alice encrypts her message as $m^e$ and sends it over to Bob. Eve intercepts this, and has an oracle that tells her the decryption of any arbitrary ciphertext via Bob's private key **except for $m^e$**. This way we can't just pass it immediately to the oracle.

    "## A Practical Example: Tencent's QQ Browser\n",
    "Sounds interesting in theory, but what about reality? Unfortunately for internet users, this type of attack is far more common than one might expect. Tencent, a Chinese technology conglomerate, owns a popular web browser named QQ Browser. Said browser was torn apart by researchers in a [2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03367.pdf) which found a shocking amount of vulnerabilities. We will take a look at the CCA2 attack in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's set the stage for the attack. Whenever a user interacts with the browswer, it sends a variety of sensitive personal information to QQ Browser servers (why a browser needs its own servers is suspicious enough) using RSA encryption to exchange a 128 bit (for our example, 16 bit) AES key. You don't need to know anything about AES for now, just know that it is a very secure symmetric cipher. The device and server then use this key to send encrypted data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to reveal a 16 bit key to decrypt all the message traffic. There are a few key observations about the server that make this feasible:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the server receives a session request, it attempts to decrypt it using the last 128 bits of the RSA plaintext as an AES key. If the decryption results in a valid session packet, it responds with some sort of success message. Otherwise, it responds with failure (or not at all).\n",

    "# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, RSA encryption is too slow for messages of any appreciable length. Therefore, we want use it to trade a symmetric cipher key (like the previous example). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of raw RSA, however, there is a more efficient solution in the form of Diffie-Hellman. It works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob wish to communicate, and Eve can spy on all their communications. Alice and Bob agree on and publish a value $g$ and modulus $N$. (There are considerable restrictions on what these need to be, but for now, let's abstract that away).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice chooses her private key $a$, and Bob chooses his key $b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alice then finds the value $g^a \\mod N$, and Bob finds $g^b \\mod N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "They send these values to each other over the insecure channel. Eve now has both $g^a$ and $g^b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Alice receives $g^b$, she raises it to the $a$-th power, finding $(g^b)^a \\equiv g^{ab} \\mod N$. Bob does the same to also find $g^{ab} \\mod N$. This a number they can then use as their symmetric key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eve, on the other hand, only has $g^a$ and $g^b$, and no easy way to find $g^{ab}$. At best, she can multiply them to find $g^{a+b}$, but that is worthless.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system relies on the fact that finding $a$ given $g^a \\mod N$ is hard. We will explore why this is the case next lab!"

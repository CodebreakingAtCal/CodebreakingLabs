    "# Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Textbook RSA is particularly susceptible to a **chosen-ciphertext attack**, in which our attacker Eve can choose an arbitrary ciphertext and have it decrypted by Bob. For example, she can encrypt a message using his public key and have him tell her the result of decrypting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds strange, since then we could just ask them to decrypt the ciphertext we wish to break. In this sense a raw chosen-ciphertext attack is not feasible in practice. We will see how a variant of it can be used to gradually reveal the full message, however, relying on the non-padded nature of RSA. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's go over how a chosen-ciphertext attack works in the basic case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say Alice encrypts her message as $m^e$ and sends it over to Bob. Eve intercepts this, and has an oracle that tells her the decryption of any arbitrary ciphertext via Bob's private key **except for $m^e$**. This way we can't just pass it immediately to the oracle. However, Eve can use some properties of modular arithmetic to her advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $C = m^e$ as our ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C^* = C \\cdot 2^e = (2m)^e$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then send this $C^*$ to the oracle and receive $$(2m)^{ed} = 2m$$. From here we can simply divide by two to get our message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This only works because the RSA ciphertext is malleable, in that we can multiply/add/etc with predictable results to the underlying message."

    "## A Practical Example: Tencent's QQ Browser\n",
    "Sounds interesting in theory, but what about reality? Unfortunately for internet users, this type of attack is far more common than one might expect. Tencent, a Chinese technology conglomerate, owns a popular web browser named QQ Browser. Said browser was torn apart by researchers in a [2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03367.pdf) which found a shocking amount of vulnerabilities. We will take a look at the CCA2 attack in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's set the stage for the attack. Whenever a user interacts with the browswer, it sends a variety of sensitive personal information to QQ Browser servers (why a browser needs its own servers is suspicious enough) using RSA encryption to exchange a 128 bit (for our example, 16 bit) AES key. You don't need to know anything about AES for now, just know that it is a very secure symmetric cipher. The device and server then use this key to send encrypted data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to reveal a 16 bit key to decrypt all the message traffic. There are a few key observations about the server that make this feasible:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the server receives a session request, it attempts to decrypt it using the last 128 bits (in our example, 16 bits) of the RSA plaintext as an AES key. If the decryption results in a valid session packet, it responds with some sort of success message. Otherwise, it responds with failure (or not at all).\n",
    "2. The RSA encryption has no padding.\n",
    "3. We can make requests to the server on our own (without needing access to the client device). "

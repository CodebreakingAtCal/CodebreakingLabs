    "\n",
    "Up to this point we have primarily been concerned with elementary ciphers or asymmetric encryption. Real-world symmetric encryption is most often accommplished by **block ciphers**, which operate on fixed-length blocks of data, much like our Merkle-Damgard hash functions did. We can model this as some function $f(k, d) = c$, taking in the key and some data $d$ to output some ciphertext $c$.\n",

    "## AES-ECB (Electronic Code Book)\n",

This can be visualized by the following (credit to the [CS 161 Textbook](https://textbook.cs161.org/crypto/symmetric.html)):"

Instead, we can generate the key material on the fly using a CSPRNG!\n",

    "In order to remedy this, we use a key principle that applies to polyalphabetic ciphers -- they are simply a combination of *monoalphabetic* ciphers. If we can split the polyalphabetic cipher into numerous monoalphabetic ones, we can solve those individually and re-combine to produce our decrypted text. For example, take the Vigenere ciphertext \"bcbc\" with key \"ab\". 'a' would be the key for the first and third letter, and 'b' is the key for the second and forth letter. Thus, we can split this into two Caesar ciphers -- \"bb\" and \"cc\". We find that our keys are 'b' and 'c', respectively, then we concatenate to find the overall key \"bc\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky part, however, is finding the key length. We can't know how to split the cipher unless we know how many ciphers to split into. Fortunately, there exists a very useful tool called the *Kasiski test* to determine the key length of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. Simply put, we look for repeated substrings of words and check the distance between the two. For example: \n",

This would imply our key could be 16 characters long or any of the factors of 16 (8, 4, 2), since the key would \"repeat\" in time for it to encrypt the same plaintext to the same ciphertext. It could be any of these, but over a long text, only the key lengths and its multiples (4, 8, 12 ..) will show up in appreciable amounts. (A notable exception is 2, just because its really small and a lot of repeats happen by chance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm for determining the key length is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find all repeated substrings of length 3 or 4 and their distances. Put this data into a dictionary with (key length -> count)\n",
    "2. Compare the proportions of these values to those of an unencrypted, very long text (same idea as comparing to base English frequency values)\n",
    "3. Collect those which are significantly above the base values and determine the key length based on least-inversions principle (this part is a bit tricky and subjective, so it is implemented for you)\n",

    "In the digital world, one of the most common methods of encoding an encoding a pixel to be a particular color is by representing that color as a RGB triplet. A RGB triplet is a list of 3 numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, where the first number represents the level of red, the second number represents the level of green, and the third number reprsents the level of blue in the image. The higher the number (i.e: the closer to 255), the more intense that component will be in the final color.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the RGB triplet `(0, 0, 0)` represents the color black, as `0` indicates the absence of a component entirely and we are asking for the absence of all three components. In contrast, the RGB triplet `(255, 255, 255)` represents the color white, as `255` indicates the full intensity for a component, and we are asking for the full intensity of all three components. Below are some examples of other RGB triplets and the colors they represent.\n",

    "So, now that we know how to represent a single pixel, how could we extropolate this to representing an entire image? Well, we can think of an image as a matrix of pixels, so we could store an image as a 2D-array of RGB triplets. Each array inside of the 2D-array represents a row of the image, and inside each of these rows are the RGB triplets for that row, stored as a list of three numbers.\n",

The human eyes' ability to differentiate different colors is quite limited. So much so, in fact, that if we change the least significant bit of one of the numbers in a RGB triplet, the change is imperceptible to ordinary human eye sight. As an example, below are two colors. One is true red (the RGB triplet is `[11111111, 00000000, 00000000]`) and one is a slightly off red (the RGB triplet is `[11111110, 00000000, 00000000]`).

    "To produce our encoded message, we will loop through the pixels inside of `message`. If the pixel in `message` is white, then we want to set the last bit of the green value in the corresponding pixel of `mask` to 1.
